My First Machine Learning Project: Sales Insights through EDA

I‚Äôm excited to share my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) journey on a sales dataset, where I‚Äôve worked on gaining meaningful insights that can drive business strategies and improve decision-making.

üîç Project Highlights:

Dataset: I‚Äôve worked with a rich sales dataset, focusing on understanding how sales are impacted by various factors like customer type, product line, payment method, time of day, and more. 

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Goals: Uncover key trends, correlations, and patterns within sales data, focusing on factors that could drive revenue growth or highlight areas for improvement.

Key Insights:
Sales Behavior: How customer type and product lines are interrelated.
Payment Method Analysis: Understanding how the method of payment correlates with total sales.
Time of Day Sales Trends: Analyzing sales patterns across different times of the day to identify peak hours.

What I‚Äôve Learned:

Data wrangling & cleaning: Addressing missing values, handling duplicates, and ensuring consistency in data.
Visualization Techniques: Leveraging powerful visualization libraries to present complex insights in an easily interpretable format.
Statistical Analysis: Building intuition on the relationship between different variables and understanding how they affect sales.
