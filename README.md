# Sales Insights through EDA

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. By analyzing key variables such as product lines, customer types, sales channels, and time of purchase, the project aims to answer critical business questions related to sales patterns and decision-making.

## Key objectives of the project:
- **Identifying trends in sales data**: Analyzing how different customer types and product lines impact overall sales.
- **Exploring customer behavior**: Understanding which customer types contribute most to specific product lines and which times of day are associated with higher sales.
- **Data-driven insights**: Drawing correlations between different features like quantity sold, unit price, and gross income to assist in sales forecasting and marketing strategies.

## Tools and Techniques used:
- **Python**: Data manipulation with Pandas and numpy, data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **EDA**: Identifying patterns and trends using statistical analysis and visualizations.
